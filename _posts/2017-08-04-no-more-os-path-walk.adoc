here i want to read from files under same directory parallelly. 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7776293/read-txt-file-with-multi-threaded-in-python

obs., `multiprocessing` is a cute module. however, i find `pathlib` rocks!

[source,python]
----
def get_pre_job_p(dirname):
    with multiprocessing.Pool() as p:
        p.map_async(get_pre_job, pathlib.Path(dirname).iterdir())
        p.close()
        p.join()

a **high level** to manipulate stuff is always better than a **low level**, for the developer's usability.
