My girlfriend's currently job is quite funny: force orders to be released in SAP complaining shortage cases.

It's ridiculous. How can achieve this goal without resource? It's quite beyond brain power.

The reason to do so is to make report beautiful.

Another kind 'do nothing'. The more you do, the more fault will raise. Even there's sth. Quite fucking important, okay, might be not that vital to crash, they won't care.

So, what's fucking meaning of using SAP. I mean, at least, you can always get instruction(s) from it. But you won't obey it. Why not just increase the threshold value, to a you happy, I happy, everyone happy situation?

It looks like they're kin to some rule and too afraid to negate it.

Procedural is a up side down.
